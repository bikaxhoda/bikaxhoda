Hi everyone!
Iâ€™m currently learning Git and looking for a practice partner to collaborate with on basic Git/GitHub projects.
We can work together on simple repos, pull requests, merge conflicts, branching, etc.
Target: Build hands-on skills and help each other grow!

âœ… Beginner-friendly
âœ… Consistent practice (3â€“4 days a week)
âœ… Communicate in Bangla/English

If youâ€™re also learning Git or want to revise your skills, feel free to DM or comment. Let's grow together! ðŸš€
